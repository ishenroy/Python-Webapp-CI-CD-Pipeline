# Python-Webapp-CI-CD-Pipeline
 
This is a simple Python Flask web application. The app provides system information and a realtime monitoring screen with dials showing CPU, memory, IO and process information.

The app has been designed with cloud native demos & containers in mind, in order to provide a real working application for deployment, something more than "hello-world" but with the minimum of pre-reqs. It is not intended as a complete example of a fully functioning architecture or complex software design.

Typical uses would be deployment to Kubernetes, demos of Docker, CI/CD (build pipelines are provided), deployment to cloud (Azure) monitoring, auto-scaling
